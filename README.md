# Task Manager App
A full-stack task management application built with **React**, **Express**, and **SQLite**. Users log in to manage their tasks, and receive AI-powered suggestions to boost productivity.

---
## Approach and Trade-offs for current version
1. Priority given to have fully working backend and frontend; then added in follow up commits:
    - Style
    - Live AI suggestions
2. To expedite development used SQLLite locally
3. Kept architecture / implementation as simple as possible:
    - Backend: express + sqllite
    - Frontend: react + tailwind css
        - JS instead of TypeScript
    - Simple authentication
    - Simple AI prompt

---
## Features
- User authentication with sessions (Express + SQLite)
- Task CRUD (create, update, complete, delete)
- Due date handling
- Active/completed task filtering
- AI-generated task suggestions (OpenAI or fallback)
- Fully responsive layout Tailwind CSS
- Filter preference persists via `localStorage`

---
## Tech Stack
### Frontend
- React
- Vite
- React Router DOM
- Tailwind CSS
- Axios

### Backend
- Node.js (Express)
- SQLite
- Express-session
- OpenAI SDK

## Setup Instructions
### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/task-manager.git
cd task-manager
```

### 2. Backend Setup

cd backend
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm run dev  # or node server.js
```

> Test login credentials:
> - alice / alice123
> - bob / bob123

### 3. Frontend Setup
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend url: http://localhost:5173
Backend url: http://localhost:4000

## Environment Variables
### `.env` (Backend)
```
PORT=4000
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

---
## AI Suggestions - Currently mock suggestions
- Uses OpenAI GPT-3.5 if `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in `.env`
- Falls back to mock suggestions if API fails

---
## Deployment <- Out of scope at this time 
- Frontend: Vercel, Netlify, or static host
- Backend: Render, Railway, or Node host
